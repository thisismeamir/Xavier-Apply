# Xavier Mind

Xavier Mind is the data processing and integration component of the Xavier project. It takes the raw data collected by Xavier Telepath and transforms it into structured, meaningful information.

## Components

### 1. Data Cleaning

Located in `xavier_mind/data_cleaning/`, this directory contains scripts for cleaning and normalizing the collected data:

- `text_processing.py`: Cleans and normalizes text data, handling issues like inconsistent formatting or encoding.
- `entity_recognition.py`: Identifies and extracts entities such as researcher names, institutions, and research topics.

### 2. Profile Generation

Located in `xavier_mind/profile_generation/`, this directory manages the creation of comprehensive profiles:

- `researcher_profile.py`: Generates detailed profiles for individual researchers, combining information from multiple sources.
- `publication_profile.py`: Creates profiles for publications, including metadata, citations, and cross-references.

### 3. Data Integration

Located in `xavier_mind/data_integration/`, this directory handles the integration of processed data:

- `knowledge_graph.py`: Builds and maintains a knowledge graph that connects researchers, publications, institutions, and research topics.

## Usage

To process the data collected by Xavier Telepath:

1. Ensure that Xavier Telepath has completed its data collection.
2. Run the main Mind script:

```
python -m xavier_mind
```

This will initiate the data processing and integration pipeline.

## Configuration

Adjust the `config.py` file to set:

- Data cleaning parameters
- Profile generation rules
- Knowledge graph schema and relationships

## Note

The quality of the output from Xavier Mind depends on the quality and completeness of the input data. Regular audits of the processed data are recommended to ensure accuracy and consistency.
