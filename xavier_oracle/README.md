# Xavier Oracle

Xavier Oracle is the interface and intelligence component of the Xavier project. It provides API endpoints for data retrieval and implements AI-driven features for advanced querying and recommendations.

## Components

### 1. API

Located in `xavier_oracle/api/`, this directory contains the API implementation:

- `routes.py`: Defines the API endpoints and their corresponding handlers.
- `handlers.py`: Implements the logic for each API endpoint, interfacing with the database and AI components.

### 2. AI

Located in `xavier_oracle/ai/`, this directory contains the AI-driven features:

- `query_processing.py`: Processes natural language queries, converting them into structured database queries.
- `response_generation.py`: Generates human-readable responses based on the query results and AI analysis.

### 3. Services

Located in `xavier_oracle/services/`, this directory contains additional services:

- `recommendation_engine.py`: Implements algorithms for generating personalized recommendations for researchers, publications, or collaborations.

## Usage

To start the Xavier Oracle API server:

1. Ensure that Xavier Mind has completed processing the data.
2. Run the main Oracle script:

```
python -m xavier_oracle
```

This will start the API server, making it available for queries.

## API Documentation

Detailed API documentation is available at `/docs` when the server is running. This includes:

- Available endpoints
- Request and response formats
- Authentication requirements
- Rate limiting information

## Configuration

Adjust the `config.py` file to set:

- API server settings (port, host, etc.)
- Authentication and authorization rules
- AI model parameters
- Recommendation algorithm settings

## Note

Ensure that proper security measures are in place, including authentication, rate limiting, and data encryption, especially when dealing with sensitive or personal information about researchers.
